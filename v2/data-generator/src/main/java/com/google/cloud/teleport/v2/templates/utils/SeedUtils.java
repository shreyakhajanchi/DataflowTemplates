/**
 * Utilities for generating high-quality, worker-unique seeds for {@link java.util.Random} and
 * {@link com.github.javafaker.Faker} instances used inside Dataflow {@code DoFn}s.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> When Dataflow autoscales, new worker VMs are typically cloned from the
 * same image. On Linux, {@link SecureRandom} (NativePRNG) is seeded from {@code /dev/urandom},
 * whose initial pool on a freshly-booted cloned VM is derived from the image's saved random-seed
 * file and can therefore be <em>identical or highly correlated</em> across clones during the narrow
 * window when the Beam harness calls {@code @Setup}. If seeding relied solely on {@code new
 * SecureRandom().nextLong()}, two freshly-booted workers could produce the same seed, and since
 * {@code new java.util.Random(seed)} is a deterministic LCG, they would then emit identical
 * sequences of random characters — producing duplicate primary keys and triggering "PK already
 * exists" errors on the sink during scale-up.
 *
 * <p>This class defends against that by mixing {@link SecureRandom} with <em>worker-local</em>
 * entropy that is not derived from {@code /dev/urandom} — hostname, PID, thread id, JVM-high-res
 * clock, a JVM-scoped monotonic counter, and a fresh object's identity hash. These components
 * differ between two Dataflow workers by construction (different hostnames, different PIDs),
 * guaranteeing that two concurrently-starting workers cannot collapse to the same seed even if
 * every kernel-entropy source misbehaves.
 *
 * <p>The mixed result is passed through SplitMix64 (the standard avalanche-quality finalizer from
 * java.util.SplittableRandom) so that structural correlations in any individual component do not
 * survive into the final seed.
 *
 * <p>Safe for concurrent use.
